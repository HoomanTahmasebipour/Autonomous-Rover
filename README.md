Autonomous Rover Project, built on top of SimMer by University of Toronto's Ian Bennet.

This project contains the MATLAB code written for the rover, which is responsible for the rover's obstacle avoidance, localization, and autonomous navigation.

The objective of the project is to design and code a rover built for autonomously navigating a maze with the purpose of finding, picking up, and delivering a cube to a specified drop off zone.

The documentation for the SimMer project can be found as a PDF in the documentation directory.

Usage:
1. In one instance of Matlab, run the "Main.m" file to begin the simulator
2. In a second instance of Matlab, run "Autonomous_Rover.m" to begin Rover operation.
